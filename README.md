# Project during PHP OO Course

Make a system following best practices, design patterns, etc... to generate a random quote.

Start by using the API of https://whatdoestrumthink.com, but it should be possible to easily extend with other quote sources (Kanye West being an obvious second candidate).

There will be over-engineering, but it is generally to convey a purpose in manageable bits and pieces.
